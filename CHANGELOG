!! CHANGE LOG !!

Version 3.2.0
Release Date: 1 Jan 2020
1. Introduction of deploy wizard, to handle installation, uninstallation and upgrade requests. Upgrade feature will be implemented soon.
2. Introduction of creating of new vnet profile via command 'vnet new' instead of manually configuration.
3. Introduction of editing of vnet profile via command 'vnet edit' instead of manually configuration.
4. Allows export/backup and import/restore of profile(s). 

Version 3.0.3
Release Date: 6 Jun 2019
1. Move network up empty file from exec dir to host system global temp ("/tmp") directory.
2. Introduction of modules directory, which currently has iptables, network tap and profile manager modules.
3. Rename config dir to profiles and thus officially supports multiple vnet(s)/bridge(s).
4. Introduction of profile manager module to allow listing of all vnet profiles, rename, delete and edit dnsmasq settings of vnet profile.
5. Introduction of iptables rulesets module and currently has 2 modules, bridge or isolated rulesets. Previously, rules are defined inside vnet main script file.


Version 2.2.0
Release Date: 29 May 2019
1.  Virtual Network here refers to bridge and vice-versa. In this documentation, virtual network shall be used instead
2.  All virtual network creation are based on config file instead of depending on both config and the shell script
3.  Shell Script is now a common platform to manage virtual network creation based on the name defined in the config file
    and thus, the shell script is now renamed as vnet ( instead of the <virtualnetworkname>-net or <bridgename>-net )
4.  All Config (.conf) files related to virtual network setup are to be stored in configstore dir located in where the shell script "vnet" is located
    a.  VirtualNet config files has a standard convention to comply with:
            i.e. <virtualnetworkname>-vnet.conf and only one such VirtualNet config file per each virtual network name is allowed.
            (for example, virtual network name virtnet will have the following filename virnet-vnet.conf
    b.  CRITICAL!! The variable VIRNET_BRIDGE defined inside VirtualNet config file must be the same as <virtualnetworkname>.
    c.  Other application based config files used by vnet script, are to be stored in this directory with the following naming convention 
            <virtualnetworkname>-vnet-<application-name>.conf 
            (for example, dnsmasq application with network name virtnet shall be named as virnet-vnet-dnsmasq.conf
    d.  Currently only dnsmasq application used by this application requires a config file.
        More applications that requires config file may be introduced in future.
    e.  Future improvement will include auto generation of <virtualnetworkname>-vnet.conf. Stay tuned.
5.  In order for vnet shell script to work, the following config files is required. This list will change the script improves with more features.
    a.  <virtualnetworkname>-vnet.conf
    b   <virtualnetworkname>-vnet-dnsmasq.conf
6.  VirtualNet config file new variable `PERSISTENT="false"` has been added from version 2.1.1 and above
    This is implemented together with systemd (service) script "vnet.service" and autoproc script "vnet-autoproc" for use with the service script.
    If PERSISTENT="true", the vnet systemd (service) script will auto setup the virtual network interface the way how the user manually executes it.
7.  Manage of virtual network during system startup and shutdown using systemd
    Setup Instructions for systemd are mentioned at the beginning of "vnet.service" file.
    a.  Auto configuration of Virtual Network Adapters/Interfaces based on the value of PERSISTENT variable inside VirtualNet config files
        If PERSISTENT="true" in <virtualnetworkname>-vnet.conf, the <virtualnetworkname> will be automatically configured on startup.
        Nothing will be processed on startup if PERSISTENT="false". Thus the user has to manually configure it.
        (e.g. testvirnet-vnet.conf, testvirnet will be automatically configured on startup)
    b.  Auto deletion of Virtual Network Adapters/Intefaces on system shutdown. 
        All <virtualnetworkname>-vnet.conf inside configstore directory will be automatically processed regardless of status.
        (i.e. Even if the <virtualnetworkname> is not setup automatically or manually by the user, it will be processed as well)
8.  Version 2.2.0 addition (2018 Apr 24)
    a.  Add dnsmasq global exclude file /etc/dnsmasq.d-available/vnet-<virtualnetworkname> and 
        symlink to /etc/dnsmasq.d-available/vnet-<virtualnetworkname> from /etc/dnsmasq.d/
    b.  Auto delete vnet-<virtualnetworkname> symlink and file on shutdown (or on stop request)



@@@@ NOTES FOR OLDER VERSION (VERSION 2.0.x and below) @@@@
@@@@ WARNING!! NOTES FOR VERSION 2.0.x and below does not apply to Version 2.1 and Above. @@@@

!! This NOTE (file) shall ALWAYS stay in this directory where files research-net, dnsmasq.conf, research-net.conf are in !! 
This is V2 of research isolated virtual bridge (research) with virtual interface (research-veth)
Setup with the use of LXD Bridge library retrieved from LXD version below <= 2.0.x
As this machine has been upgraded to version 2.2.*, thus the config files are available in this dir "references" with filename "lxd-bridge files pre2.3.zip"
****

1. There is a directory named "@archived" which will contains all the older versions to use/run incase of emergency or for reference use.
Label the version with V* (e.g. Version 1 shall be V1 and Version 1.2 shall be V1.2)

1. In case dnsmasq doesn't work even with research-veth bridged to research interface
Create a file and place the text inside "Contents" section below to /etc/dnsmasq.d/research
==== Contents below here ====
# Tell any system-wide dnsmasq instance to make sure to bind to interfaces
# instead of listening on 0.0.0.0
# WARNING: changes to this file will get lost if lxc is removed.
